    "Complexity: Multithreading adds a layer of complexity to the program, which can make it more difficult to understand and debug.\n",

    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release resources that they need. Deadlocks can occur when there are shared resources, and each thread is waiting for another thread to release a resource that it needs to continue. In a deadlock, the threads are stuck in a loop waiting for each other, and the program cannot proceed. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and prevent, and can lead to the program crashing or becoming unresponsive.\n",

Race conditions can occur when two or more threads access a shared resource, and the order of their access is not controlled. This can lead to situations where the program's behavior is"
