    "\n",
    "Abstraction: This involves hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the relevant information to the outside world. This allows objects to be treated as black boxes, making it easier to use and understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: This involves wrapping data and functions within an object, making it a self-contained entity. This helps to protect the data from outside interference and modification, and promotes data security and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: This involves creating a new class from an existing class. The new class inherits all the attributes and methods of the existing class, and can add new attributes and methods or override existing ones. This allows for code reusability and helps to avoid code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: This involves creating objects that can take on multiple forms. This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This makes it possible to write generic code that can work with objects of different classes, as long as they implement a common interface."

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class to be derived from an existing class. The derived class inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the existing class, and it can add new attributes or override existing behaviors as needed. The main idea behind inheritance is to promote code reuse and to allow for a more organized and efficient design of complex systems.\n",

    "There are several types of inheritance, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a derived class is derived from a single base class. For example, a \"Bird\" class can be derived from an \"Animal\" class, where the Bird class inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the Animal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a derived class is derived from multiple base classes. For example, a \"FlyingFish\" class can be derived from both \"Fish\" and \"Bird\" classes, where the FlyingFish class inherits the attributes and behaviors of both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-level Inheritance: In multi-level inheritance, a derived class is derived from a derived class, which is derived from a base class. For example, a \"Penguin\" class can be derived from a \"Bird\" class, which is derived from an \"Animal\" class, where the Penguin class inherits the attributes and behaviors of the Bird class and the Animal class.\n",

    "Hierarchical Inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes are derived from a single base class. For example, a \"Duck\" class and a \"Swan\" class can be derived from a \"Bird\" class, where both classes inherit the attributes and behaviors of the Bird class.\n",

    "Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. For example, a \"Parrot\" class can be derived from both a \"Bird\" class and a \"TalkingAnimal\" class, where the Parrot class inherits the attributes and behaviors of both classes."
